Description: 
    G-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique nucleic acid secondary structures 
    predominantly found in guanine-rich regions and have been shown to be 
    involved in various biological regulatory processes. G4SNVHunter is an R 
    package designed to rapidly identify genomic sequences with G4-forming 
    potential and accurately screen user-provided single nucleotide variants 
    (also applicable to single nucleotide polymorphisms) that may destabilize 
    these G4 structures. This enables users to screen key variants for further 
    experimental study, investigating how these variants may influence 
    biological functions, such as gene regulation, by altering G4 formation.
