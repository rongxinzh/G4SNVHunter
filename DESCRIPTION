Description: 
    G-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique nucleic acid secondary structures 
    predominantly found in guanine-rich regions and have been shown to be 
    involved in various biological regulatory processes. 
    G4SNVHunter is an R package designed to rapidly identify genomic sequences 
    with G4-forming propensity and to accurately screen user-provided 
    single nucleotide variants—as well as other small-scale variants such as 
    indels and MNVs—for their potential to destabilize these structures.
    This allows researchers to then screen these critical variants for deeper 
    study, digging into how they might influence biological functions—think 
    gene regulation, for instance—by impairing G4 formation propensity.
